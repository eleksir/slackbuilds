Gitea - Git with a cup of tea

Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub,
Bitbucket, and GitLab. Gitea is a fork of Gogs.

The goal of this project is to provide the easiest, fastest, and most painless
way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an
independent binary distribution across all platforms and architectures that Go
supports. This support includes Linux, macOS, and Windows, on architectures
like amd64, i386, ARM, PowerPC, and others.

In order to run gitea you should create user named git (for example) and
adjust configs according selected username.

groupadd -g 5001 git
useradd -u 5001 -d /var/lib/git -s /bin/bash -g git git

Git requires valid shell to operate properly, so in sshd config you should
disable password-less login. Ideally allow only certificate authrized logins
via ssh.

Don't forget to set long enough random complex password for this user and
forget it immediately.

Also never give this user full sudo privileges.
