FileZilla Client is a fast and reliable cross-platform FTP, FTPS and
SFTP client with lots of useful features and an intuitive graphical user
interface.

pugixml is an optional dependency - to use an installed version of pugixml,
run the script as "PUGIXML=yes ./filezilla.SlackBuild" - otherwise, the
build will use an included copy of pugixml.


N.B.
Filzilla requires c++17, so it can be built with gcc-8 and more recent
In this slackbuild gcc-10.2.0 is used, there are some gcc version dependent
flags set in slackbuild.
