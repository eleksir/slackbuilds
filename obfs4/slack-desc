# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

obfs4: obfs4 (The obfourscator)
obfs4:
obfs4: This is a look-like nothing obfuscation protocol that incorporates
obfs4: ideas and concepts from Philipp Winter's ScrambleSuit protocol. The
obfs4: obfs naming was chosen primarily because it was shorter, in terms of
obfs4: protocol ancestery obfs4 is much closer to ScrambleSuit than
obfs4: obfs2/obfs3.
